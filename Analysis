Written-Analysis

Based on the results from this challenge, here is my conclusion about PyCitySchools according to the data

1- Charter schools perform better that District Schools.
2 – The school size plays an important role in the student's overall performance; students perform better in a small setting compared to a large setting.
3 – The school budget also plays a role in the student's performance, and based on what we see in this case, students are performing better at a lower budget in small Charter schools than they are at a higher budget in large District schools.
